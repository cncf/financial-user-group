This document describes the purpose and goals of the Cloud Native Computing
Foundation (CNCF) Financial Services User Group. This group will work to develop
the financial end user community and collaborate with other CNCF projects and 
technical advisory groups. It will deliver artifacts intended to educate
the financial end user community on cloud native initiatives, projects, and
ways of operating. It will also deliver artifacts intended to educate the
broader cloud native community on financial services goals, requirements,
and challenges.

                challenges, and the unique policy and regulatory constraints
                that financial services operate under.
