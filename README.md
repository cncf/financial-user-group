# CNCF Financial Services User Group

The primary aim of this group is to foster interest and engagement from the finance industry to address security, regulatory and compliance related issues when using cloud native platforms.  This would include the preparation of agreed best practices for the use of cloud native technologies in a regulated financial services context including interaction with common regulators and auditors.
